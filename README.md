A company specializing in Big Data and Data Science seeks to hire data scientists from its training courses participants. To optimize training quality and planning, it aims to predict which candidates are interested in joining the company post-training versus those seeking other opportunities. This involves analyzing candidates' demographics, education, and experience data to identify factors influencing their job-seeking intentions.
